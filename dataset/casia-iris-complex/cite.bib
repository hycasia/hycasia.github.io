  abstract  = {A large portion of iris images captured in real world applications are poor quality due to limited depth of field and dynamic user pose. It is difficult to achieve a good balance between iris image quality criteria and high throughput of personal identification. This paper proposes a recognition-oriented method for iris image quality assessment to deal with the problem. The method regards the iris image embeddings Distance in Feature Space (DFS) as the quality metric and the prediction is based on deep neural networks with the attention mechanism. The relationship between Image Rejection Rate (IRR) and Equal Error Rate (EER) is proposed to evaluate the performance of the quality assessment algorithm under the same image quality distribution and the same recognition algorithm. The quality metric proposed in this paper can significantly improve the performance of the recognition algorithm while reducing the number of images discarded for recognition, which is advantageous over hand-crafted factor based iris quality assessment methods.},
